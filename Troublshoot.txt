git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
PS C:\HTML_Projects\My-first-github-repo

Solutions: in Git Bash terminal

Step 1: Verify SSH Agent and Key
#ssh-add -l

#ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Step 2: Double-check the Key on GitHub
Ensure that the correct public key is added to your GitHub account.

Open Git Bash and run:

#cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

This will output your public key. Copy everything from ssh-ed25519 to the end (the entire line).

Go to GitHub SSH Keys Settings.

Make sure this public key is listed in the SSH Keys section.

If it's not there, click New SSH Key, paste the key, and save.



 Step 3: Test Connection Again
After verifying the above, try testing the connection to GitHub again

#ssh -T git@github.com
